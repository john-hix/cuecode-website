This section outlines the key workflows users will engage with when using CueCode:

- **Translate natural language to API requests:** Users input commands such as “Get the latest sales data,” and CueCode converts it into a valid API call.
- **Validation and error handling:** CueCode ensures all API requests are secure and valid before sending.
- **Custom configuration:** Developers can adjust how commands are interpreted and mapped to APIs.
- **Deployment workflows:** CueCode can be deployed in both cloud and on-premise environments.

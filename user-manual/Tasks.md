This section outlines core tasks users can perform within CueCode:

- **Submit a command:** Type a phrase like “Get all customer emails from last week.”
- **Validate API response:** Confirm that CueCode generated the correct structured payload.
- **Customize interaction:** Developers can fine-tune input-output behavior by adding rules.
- **Use templates:** Admins can set predefined templates for repeatable queries (e.g., weekly reports).
- **Monitor activity:** Track user interactions through a dashboard (planned feature).

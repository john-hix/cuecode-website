# CueCode Prototype Overview

## 1. Purpose

This document provides developers with a technically oriented and comprehensive description of CueCode‚Äôs prototype requirements. It continues the product description from CS411W [1], where CueCode was introduced from a non-technical perspective.

This document outlines the technical foundation, architecture, and scope of the prototype. It focuses on the prototype‚Äôs goals, which contrast with the full-featured real-world product (RWP) that was previously explored in CS410 by Team Red.

---

## 2. Scope

The prototype will extend core ideas introduced in Zafin‚Äôs cosine similarity and LLM-based API payload generator [2]. CueCode builds on this by introducing a **payload ordering algorithm** that ensures correct sequencing of generated API requests ‚Äî critical for respecting data dependencies between calls.

While the prototype will not fully implement all features expected of the RWP, it will focus on:

- Translating natural language to ordered API payloads (based on an OpenAPI spec)
- Processing user intent with cosine similarity
- Supporting modular runtime and configuration workflows
- Integrating human review into the payload flow for safety

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This version of CueCode does not yet support automatic introspection of APIs to identify field names or object relationships. That feature is reserved for the RWP.

## 3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **API Payload (informal)** | JSON or XML-formatted data sent in an API request/response |
| **CueCode Developer Portal** | Web-based interface to configure APIs and manage NLP settings |
| **HTTP Header** | Metadata such as content type, authorization, etc. |
| **HTTP** | Protocol used for data communication on the web |
| **Hypermedia** | Content on the web linked through RESTful services |
| **OpenAPI Specification** | Machine-readable description of an API‚Äôs endpoints |
| **REST** | Architectural style for building stateless web APIs |
| **RWP** | Real-World Product ‚Äì full version of CueCode (non-prototype) |
| **URL** | A web address specifying location of a resource |

---

## 4. Product Perspective

CueCode offers developers a structured framework to convert **natural language** into **REST API payloads** using OpenAPI configurations. The system is composed of five modular components:

1. **Common** (shared utilities)
2. **Web Framework**
3. **Configuration Algorithm**
4. **Runtime Algorithm**
5. **Worker Process (Actors)**

### System Modes

CueCode runs in two distinct modes:
- **Web Server Mode** ‚Äì for processing API requests at runtime
- **Worker Mode** ‚Äì used during configuration phase (powered by [Dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io)) [8]

### Workflow Overview

At runtime, developers call CueCode via HTTP APIs. The service interprets natural language, generates a valid sequence of REST payloads, and returns them to the client system. The calling application can then:
- Apply **business rules**
- Let users **review** payloads
- Dispatch the payloads in order

This ensures human or automated oversight of LLM-generated outputs ‚Äî an increasingly essential design requirement in production LLM applications [2], [6].

---

## 5. Functional Architecture

### CueCode Developer Portal (Prototype)

In the prototype, the Developer Portal:
- Accepts an OpenAPI spec
- Triggers CueCode‚Äôs **Configuration Algorithm**
- Prepares runtime modules for payload generation

> üìå This portal is a simplified version of what will exist in the RWP, where full integration dashboards, analytics, and multiple API sets will be supported.

---

## 6. Runtime Process

The prototype system will:
- Accept **natural language input**
- Generate **REST API payloads** in the correct sequence
- Return those payloads via an HTTP API
- Allow the calling app to process and dispatch the payloads

Figure 3 (omitted here) describes the interaction between runtime modules and the API authentication system. CueCode‚Äôs architecture allows for safe and scalable handling of user input while supporting human-in-the-loop validation.

## 7. System Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Web Server** | Receives API requests and responds with payloads |
| **Worker Mode (Actors)** | Handles configuration-time processing |
| **Redis/Postgres** | Stores all application state (app is stateless otherwise) |
| **Client Libraries** | Enables integration in multiple programming languages |

---

## 8. Prototype vs. Real-World Product (RWP)

| Feature | Prototype | Real-World Product (RWP) |
|--------|------------|---------------------------|
| Translate natural language to payloads | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Payload ordering for dependencies | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Accept OpenAPI spec | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Introspect target API to detect field names | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Full Developer Portal | Partial | Full dashboard |
| Client library support | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Human review & business rules support | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Generate UI for API | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Search-based entity mapping | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

## 9. Summary

CueCode's prototype is designed to prove the feasibility of a safe, LLM-powered interface for API automation. It includes features for natural language interpretation, dependency-aware API payload generation, and modular system design for configuration and runtime logic.

While limited in scope compared to the real-world product (RWP), this prototype will serve as a foundation for future development, incorporating feedback from early testing and technical evaluation.

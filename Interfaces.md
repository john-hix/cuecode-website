CueCode has several key interfaces:

## 1. User Interface (UI)
- A simple, web-based UI for non-technical staff to type commands.
- Intuitive and minimal, focusing on accessibility.

## 2. NLP Module
- Interprets natural language and maps it to backend APIs.
- Can be connected to external LLMs (e.g., GPT, spaCy).

## 3. API Integration Layer
- Handles structured requests and communication with external services.
- Supports REST, GraphQL, and other formats.

## 4. Admin Panel (if applicable)
- Allows developers to customize rules and monitor API usage.
